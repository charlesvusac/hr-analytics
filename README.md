# hr-analytics
Interactive HR analytics dashboard that visualizes employee data, turnover trends, and hiring metrics. Built with Power BI to support 
data-driven workforce planning and strategic HR decision-making.

# Overview
This project analyzes realworld HR data to identify patterns related to employee attrition, demographics, and satisfaction. 
It was built to demonstrate end-to-end analytics skills — from data cleaning and transformation to visualization and insight reporting.

# Tools
* PowerBI for dashboard visualization
* Power Query for data cleaning and data transformations

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Performed an initial review of the dataset to assess data integrity, identify missing or inconsistent values, and ensure accuracy
* Analyzed key columns such as education, age, salary, years at the company, and job role to identify meaningful groupings for
  attrition analysis

# Data Preparation
* Cleaned and transformed the dataset by handling missing values and standardizing data formats

Before cleaning and tranforming:

* The raw dataset contained missing values, inconsistent formatting, and redundant columns that needed to be standardized before analysis.

After cleaning and transforming:

# Key Insights & Findings

* Employees with lower salaries and shorter tenure showed higher attrition rates.
* Certain job roles such as Research scientists experienced significantly higher turnover compared to others.
* Younger age groups and employees with a life science or medical background are more likely to leave.
* Attrition trends highlight opportunities to provide actionable insights to support HR in improving retention strategies.
